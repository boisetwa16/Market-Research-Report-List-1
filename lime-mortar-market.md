<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lime Mortar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulic Lime Mortars</li><li>Non-hydraulic Lime Mortar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lime mortar market is divided into two main types: hydraulic lime mortars and non-hydraulic lime mortars. Hydraulic lime mortars contain natural pozzolans or additives that allow them to set and harden in the presence of water, making them suitable for damp environments and structural applications. In contrast, non-hydraulic lime mortars rely solely on carbonation for curing, offering flexibility and breathability, ideal for historical restorations and projects where moisture control is paramount. Both types serve distinct construction needs.</p></p>
